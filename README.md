# Michigan Hackers iOS Tutorial Project 2019 - 2020

This is an iOS introductory tutorial project in which you will make QuickOrder, a very simple item ordering app. Along the way, you will learn how to use the basic elements of Swift such as UIButtons, UITextFields, and UITableViews. You'll also use Google's API to implement Google Places and learn how to install pods using CocoaPods.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IxiKkcnGmLo9F7F0law4snVHIrnhfTQIjLtwQ8JMQU/edit#heading=h.aq00r3azg5hk).
